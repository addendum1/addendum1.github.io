# Installation Instructions

Instructions for setting up Addendum Builder can be found below.  The basic steps are:
 - Setup the database
 - Clone/copy the code to your local environment
 - Edit the web.config to include your database connection info
 - Install the .NET code to the web server

It probably goes without saying, but you'll want to review the code and its associated components to ensure that they meet your organization's security standards.

### STEP 1: Setup the Database

Create a Microsoft SQL Database by executing this script:

```
GO
/****** Object:  Table [dbo].[Docs] ******/
SET ANSI_NULLS ON
GO
SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON
GO
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Docs](
	[Id] [int] NOT NULL,
	[PeepID] [int] NOT NULL,
	[ActiveAsOf] [nvarchar](50) NULL,
	[Status] [nvarchar](50) NULL,
	[DocXML] [nvarchar](max) NOT NULL,
	[MaxVal] [int] NULL,
	[DocType] [nvarchar](50) NULL,
	[CreatedDate] [nvarchar](50) NULL,
	[CreatedBy] [nvarchar](50) NULL,
	[LastUpdatedDate] [nvarchar](50) NULL,
	[LastUpdatedBy] [nvarchar](50) NULL,
	[CnNum] [nvarchar](50) NULL
) ON [PRIMARY] TEXTIMAGE_ON [PRIMARY]
GO
/****** Object:  Table [dbo].[ExportTemplates] ******/
SET ANSI_NULLS ON
GO
SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON
GO
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[ExportTemplates](
	[Id] [int] NOT NULL,
	[Title] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,
	[Header] [nvarchar](max) NULL,
	[Footer] [nvarchar](max) NULL
) ON [PRIMARY] TEXTIMAGE_ON [PRIMARY]
GO
/****** Object:  Table [dbo].[Peeps] ******/
SET ANSI_NULLS ON
GO
SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON
GO
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Peeps](
	[Id] [int] NOT NULL,
	[PersonEID] [nvarchar](max) NOT NULL,
	[Year] [nvarchar](250) NULL
) ON [PRIMARY] TEXTIMAGE_ON [PRIMARY]
GO
/****** Object:  Table [dbo].[SystemUsers] ******/
SET ANSI_NULLS ON
GO
SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON
GO
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[SystemUsers](
	[Id] [int] NOT NULL,
	[HashedUserID] [nvarchar](500) NOT NULL,
	[HashedUserPW] [nvarchar](500) NOT NULL,
	[Hint] [nvarchar](50) NULL,
	[EditTemplate] [bit] NULL
) ON [PRIMARY]
GO
```
Upon execution, you should have four tables in your database:

Table | Description
--- | ---
Docs | Holds finished documents
ExportTemplates | Holds the base template for output to Microsoft Word
Peeps | People to which each document is associated
SystemUsers | Stores the users of the Addendum Builder system

Note that all data in the database is stored in an encrypted format, and is never unencrypted on the server.  It is transmitted to the browser in an encrypted format, and unencrypted there using the Crypto-JS package.

Follow standard practices to pull a copy of the code into your environment.

### Step 3: Edit the Web.config File

You will need to edit the line in the `web.config` file that contains the details of the database connection.
